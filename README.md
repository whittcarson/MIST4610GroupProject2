# DESCRIPTION OF DATASET


# QUESTION 1

### QUESTION: 
Is there a correlation between newer PHEV and BEV car models and longer electric car ranges? And if so, how significant is that correlation?

### SIGNIFIGANCE: 

### GRAPH

After viewing the results of the first diagram, we filtered the data to include only the top 20 makes of cars with model year 2008 or later. This change aided in eliminating outliers and void space on the visual from the years 1996-2007. Our results show a similar trend to the initial graph for each vehicle type. BEVs have a large uptick in their average range starting in 2008 and peaking at 245 average miles in 2010. Then 2011 still showed a steep decline in efficiency, followed by a positive trend until peaking again in 2020 at approximately 278 miles average for Battery Electric Vehicles. The Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles are not nearly as efficient in terms of average range, but, notably, their data mirrors the spike in 2010 with a following drop. Also, as in the first visual, the data shows that PHEVs never received the attention in development to exceed that previous peak as the BEV trend shows. A separate detail on the tail end of the diagram after 2020. PHEVS’ continue their slight up-and-down trend, but there is very little or zero data for BEVs. This is mainly due to a lack of owners buying newer vehicles around this time.


# QUESTION 2

### QUESTION: 
"Which make of car has the highest rate of purchase for each type of electric vehicle in Washington?"

### SIGNIFIGANCE: 
This question and the relevant data are signifigant as it allows one to understand who the market leaders are for both PHEV's and BEV's. By understanding who the market leaders are in the electric car market, consumers can make more informed decisions on what kind of electric vehicle to purchase. In the mind of many consumers, BEV's and PHEV's with more marketshare maybe better options than BEV's and PHEV's with less marketshare as there must be a reason that more of one kind of car is bought over others. 

### PHEV's:

# MANIPULATIONS
We did not manipulate any raw data, but we did apply measurable functions to certain columns. For example, we applied the count function to "Electric Vehicle Range" in Q1 in order to show the number of EV types and discrepancies between EV makes. Also, we applied the average function to "Electric Range '' in Q2 to set a standard for comparing the electric range year-after-year in the graph. All filters/marks applied to the data are solely intended to show the viewer quantifiable information related to the questions. In regards to integrity, our data has no inaccuracies, irrelevancies, or 3rd party imports.
